## 📋 Detailed Task Descriptions

---

### Task 1 — Calculator Application

**Goal:** Build an arithmetic calculator with a user-friendly menu.

**Features:**
- Six operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Power
- Division-by-zero and modulus-by-zero exception handling
- Non-numeric input recovery (re-prompts without crashing)
- Continuous operation until user exits

**Sample Interaction:**
```
Enter choice: 4
Enter first number : 22
Enter second number: 0
[MATH ERROR] Division by zero is not allowed!

Enter choice: 6
Enter first number : 2
Enter second number: 8
Result: 2.00 ^ 8.00 = 256.000000
```

**Core Skills:** `static` methods, `switch-case`, `try-catch`, `Scanner`

---

### Task 2 — Temperature Converter

**Goal:** Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

**Features:**
- Any-to-any conversion via Celsius pivot
- Absolute zero boundary validation for all scales
- Shows conversion result AND all three scale equivalents
- Continuous conversion loop

**Conversion Formulas Used:**
```
°C → °F : (C × 9/5) + 32
°F → °C : (F − 32) × 5/9
°C →  K : C + 273.15
 K → °C : K − 273.15
```

**Core Skills:** Mathematical operations, method decomposition, input validation

---

### Task 3 — To-Do List Application

**Goal:** Build a full task manager with priorities, status tracking, and filtering.

**Features:**
- Add tasks with title, description, and priority (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- View all tasks with visual priority icons: `[!!!]` `[ ! ]` `[   ]`
- Mark tasks as COMPLETE
- Delete with confirmation prompt
- Filter by status or priority
- View detailed task info
- Live summary header (total / pending / completed)

**Class Design:**
```
Task (model) → TaskManager (service) → TodoListApp (UI)
```

**Core Skills:** OOP classes & objects, `ArrayList`, enums, encapsulation

---

### Task 4 — Number Guessing Game

**Goal:** Guess a randomly generated number with feedback and difficulty levels.

**Features:**
- 4 difficulty levels (Easy / Normal / Hard / Expert) with different ranges
- Hot/Cold proximity hints (Very Hot / Warm / Cool / Very Cold)
- Directional arrow hints (Too High / Too Low)
- Visual progress bar: `[●●●○○○○] 3/7 used`
- Warnings at 2 remaining and last attempt
- Cross-round session statistics (win rate, best round, avg guesses)

**Core Skills:** `java.util.Random`, `while` loops, conditionals, static fields

---

### Task 5 — Text File Analyzer

**Goal:** Analyze any `.txt` file for comprehensive statistics.

**Features:**
- Counts: lines, words, sentences, paragraphs
- Counts: characters with and without spaces
- Top-10 most frequent word ranking
- Longest line detection
- Reading level estimate (Elementary → Academic)
- Case-insensitive keyword search with line numbers and occurrence counts
- Built-in sample file creator for instant demo

**Core Skills:** `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `HashMap`, regex

---

### Task 6 — Basic Banking System

**Goal:** Simulate a multi-account banking system with full OOP.

**Features:**
- Open Savings (4% annual interest, ₹500 min balance) or Current accounts (₹10K overdraft)
- Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer between accounts
- Check balance (with withdrawable balance for savings)
- Full timestamped transaction history per account
- List all accounts with totals
- Apply monthly interest to all savings accounts
- 3 pre-seeded demo accounts on launch

**Inheritance Hierarchy:**
```
BankAccount (abstract)
├── SavingsAccount  → 4% interest, minimum balance rule
└── CurrentAccount  → overdraft facility, no interest
```

**Custom Exceptions:**
- `InsufficientFundsException` (with amount vs available balance detail)
- `AccountNotFoundException`

**Core Skills:** Abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, custom exceptions, `LocalDateTime`

## 📚 Learning Path Recommendation

```
Week 1  ──► Tasks 1 & 2  (Syntax, methods, math, input)
Week 2  ──► Tasks 3 & 4  (OOP basics, collections, game logic)
Week 3  ──► Tasks 5 & 6  (File I/O, full OOP, inheritance)
```

---

## 🚀 Extension Challenges

Once comfortable with all 6 tasks, try these upgrades:

1. **Task 1+**: Add scientific calculator functions (sin, cos, log, sqrt)
2. **Task 3+**: Persist tasks to a file between sessions (File I/O)
3. **Task 4+**: Add a leaderboard stored in a file (top 5 scores)
4. **Task 5+**: Generate an HTML report of the analysis
5. **Task 6+**: Add PIN authentication and account locking after 3 wrong attempts
6. **Combined**: Build a CLI that integrates tasks 3 & 6 — a personal finance tracker
